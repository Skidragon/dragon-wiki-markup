    A dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire-spewing and with serpentine, reptilian or avian traits, that features in the myths of many cultures around the world. The two most well-known cultural traditions of dragon are:
    <ul>
      <li>The <em class="dragon type">European</em> dragon, derived from European folk traditions and <strong>ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies</strong>. Most are depicted as <b>reptilian creatures</b> with animal-level intelligence,
        and are uniquely six-limbed (four legs and a separate set of wings).</li>
      <li>The <em class="dragon type">Chinese</em> dragon, with counterparts in <span class="country">Japan</span> (namely the <em class="dragon type">Japanese</em> dragon), <span class="country">Korea</span> and other <span class="country">East Asian</span>        and <span class="country">South Asian</span> countries. Most are depicted as <b>serpentine creatures</b> with above-average intelligence, and are quadrupeds (four legs and wingless).</li>
    </ul>
    The two traditions may have evolved separately, <em>but have influenced each other to a certain extent</em>, particularly with the <strong>cross-cultural contact of recent centuries</strong>. The English word dragon and Latin word <i class="foreign word">draco</i>    derive from Greek <i class="foreign word">δράκων</i> (drákōn), "dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake".

    <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2> Metal Asian dragon The word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French dragon, which in turn comes from Latin draconem (nominative draco) meaning "huge serpent, dragon", from the Greek word <i class = "foreign word>"δράκων</i>, drakon (genitive
    drakontos, δράκοντος) "serpent, giant seafish". The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological, and this usage was also current in English up to the 18th century. Morphology A dragon is a mythological representation
    of a reptile. In antiquity, dragons were mostly envisaged as serpents. Since the Middle Ages, however, it has become common to depict dragons with legs, resembling a lizard. Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body like a huge lizard,
    or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. The European dragon has bat-like wings growing from its back. A dragon-like creature with wings but only a single pair of legs is known as a wyvern. There is a
    modern tendency to depict dragons with back legs only and using their wings (walking on the carpal joints) as front legs, as it is thought that pterosaurs did. An example is Smaug as depicted in the film version of The Hobbit by Tolkien. Comparative
    mythology Further information: Chaoskampf, Sea serpent, Proto-Indo-European religion § Dragon or Serpent, and Serpent (Bible) The association of the serpent with a monstrous opponent overcome by a heroic deity has its roots in the mythology of the
    Ancient Near East, including Canaanite (Hebrew, Ugaritic), Hittite and Mesopotamian. Humbaba, the fire-breathing dragon-fanged beast first described in the Epic of Gilgamesh, is sometimes described as a dragon with Gilgamesh playing the part of dragon-slayer.
    Samuel Noah Kramer, in his book Sumerian Mythology, interprets the myths involving the slaying of the Kur by Enki, Ninurta, and Inanna as dragon-slaying myths. Greek red-figure vase painting depicting Heracles slaying the Lernaean hydra, c. 375-340
    BC The story of a hero slaying a giant serpent occurs in nearly every Indo-European mythology. In most stories, the hero is some kind of thunder-god. Examples include Indra, who, according to the Rigveda, slew the serpent Vritra, Zeus, who, according
    to Hesiod's Theogony, slew the serpent Typhon, and Thor, who, according to the Eddas, slew the Midgard serpent. In nearly every iteration of the story, the serpent is either multi-headed or "multiple" in some other way. The Lernaean Hydra, slain by
    Heracles, had nine heads; Hesiod describes Typhon as having one hundred heads, and Vritra is likewise described as multi-headed. Furthermore, in nearly every story, the serpent is always somehow associated with water. The Hydra was said to reside
    in the swamps of Lerna, and the name hydra itself means "water". The Midgard Serpent was said to dwell in the ocean surrounding Midgard, and Vritra was the cause of drought. The later folklore motif of the dragon guarding gold may have come from earlier
    Bronze Age customs of introducing serpents to village granaries to deter rats or mice. Saint George Killing the Dragon, 1434/35, by Martorell

      Coat of arms of the Hungarian House of Lacković Although dragons occur in many legends around the world, different cultures have varying stories about monsters that have been grouped together under the dragon label. Some dragons are said to breathe fire
      or to be poisonous, such as in the Old English poem Beowulf. They are commonly portrayed as serpentine or reptilian, hatching from eggs and possessing typically scaly or feathered bodies. They are sometimes portrayed as hoarding treasure. Some myths
      portray them with a row of dorsal spines. European dragons are more often winged, while Chinese dragons resemble large snakes. Dragons can have a variable number of legs: none, two, four, or more when it comes to early European literature. Dragons
      are often held to have major spiritual significance in various religions and cultures around the world. In many Asian cultures, dragons were, and in some cultures still are, revered as representative of the primal forces of nature, religion, and
      the universe. They are associated with wisdom—often said to be wiser than humans—and longevity. They are commonly said to possess some form of magic or other supernatural power, and are often associated with wells, rain, and rivers. In some cultures,
      they are also said to be capable of human speech. In some traditions dragons are said to have taught humans to talk.

      The Order of the Dragon was created to defend Europe against the invading Ottoman Turks in the 15th century. Narratives about dragons often involve their being killed by a hero. This topos can be traced to the Chaoskampf of the mythology of the Ancient
      Near East (e.g. Hadad vs. Yam, Marduk vs. Tiamat, Teshub vs. Illuyanka, etc.; the Biblical Leviathan presumably reflects a corresponding opponent of an early version of Yahweh). The motif is continued in Greek Apollo, and the early Christian narratives
      about Michael the Archangel and Saint George. The slaying of Vrtra by Indra in the Rigveda also belongs in this category. The theme survives into medieval legend and folklore, with dragon slayers such as Beowulf, Sigurd, Tristan, Margaret the Virgin,
      Heinrich von Winkelried, Dobrynya Nikitich, Skuba Dratewka/Krakus. In the Bible, the archetype is alluded to in the descendants of Adam crushing the head of the Serpent, and in Christian mythology, this was interpreted as corresponding to Christ
      as the Last Adam crushing the Devil. The blood of a slain dragon is depicted as either beneficent or as poisonous in medieval legend and literary fiction. In German legend, dragon blood has the power to render invincible skin or armor bathed in
      it, as is the case with Siegfried's skin or Ortnit's armor. In the Slavic myth, the Earth refuses it as being so vile that Mother Earth wishes not to have it within her womb, and it remains above ground for all eternity. The blood of the dragon
      in Beowulf has acidic qualities, allowing it to seep through iron. Heinrich von Winkelried dies after the blood of the dragon slain by him accidentally drips on him.
